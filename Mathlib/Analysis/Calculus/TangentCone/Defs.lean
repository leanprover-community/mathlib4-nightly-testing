# Tangent cone

In this file, we define two predicates `UniqueDiffWithinAt 𝕜 s x` and `UniqueDiffOn 𝕜 s`
ensuring that, if a function has two derivatives, then they have to coincide. As a direct
definition of this fact (quantifying on all target types and all functions) would depend on
universes, we use a more intrinsic definition: if all the possible tangent directions to the set
`s` at the point `x` span a dense subset of the whole subset, it is easy to check that the
derivative has to be unique.

Therefore, we introduce the set of all tangent directions, named `tangentConeAt`,
and express `UniqueDiffWithinAt` and `UniqueDiffOn` in terms of it.
One should however think of this definition as an implementation detail: the only reason to
introduce the predicates `UniqueDiffWithinAt` and `UniqueDiffOn` is to ensure the uniqueness
of the derivative. This is why their names reflect their uses, and not how they are defined.

## Implementation details

Note that this file is imported by `Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Basic.lean`. Hence, derivatives
are not defined yet. The property of uniqueness of the derivative is therefore proved in
`Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Basic.lean`, but based on the properties of the tangent cone we
prove here.

section TangentConeAt

variable [AddCommGroup E] [SMul R E] [TopologicalSpace E] {s : Set E} {x y : E}

/-- The set of all tangent directions to the set `s` at the point `x`.

A point `y` belongs to the tangent cone of `s` at `x` iff
there exist a family of scalars `c n`, a family of vectors `d n`,
and a nontrivial filter in the index type such that

- `d n → 0` along the filter;
- `x + d n ∈ s` eventually along the filter;
- `c n • d n → y` along the filter,

The actual definition is given in terms of cluster points of a filter,
see `mem_tangentConeAt_of_seq` and `exists_fun_of_mem_tangentConeAt`
for the two implications unfolding this definition in more convenient way.

In a space with first countable topology,
one can assume that the index type is `ℕ` and the filter is `atTop`,
but the definition we use is more useful without that assumption.

/-- Let `c n` be a family of scalars, `d n` be a family of vectors, and `l` be a filter such that

- `d n → 0` along `l`;
- `x + d n ∈ s` frequently along `l`;
- `c n • d n → y` along `l`.

Then `y` belongs to the tangent cone of `s` at `x`.

/-- If `y` belongs to the tangent cone of `s` at `x`, then there exist

- an index type `α` and a nontrivial filter `l` on `α`;
- a family of scalars `c n`, `n : α`, and a family of vectors `d n`, `n : α` such that
- `d n → 0` along `l`;
- `x + d n ∈ s` eventually along `l`;
- `c n • d n → y` along `l`.

In fact, one can take `α = R × E`, `c = Prod.fst`, and `d = Prod.snd`, but this is not important,
so the lemma statement hides these details.

This lemma provides a convenient way to unfold the definition of `tangentConeAt`. -/

/-- A property ensuring that the tangent cone to `s` at `x` spans a dense subset of the whole space.
The main role of this property is to ensure that the differential within `s` at `x` is unique,
hence this name. The uniqueness it asserts is proved in `UniqueDiffWithinAt.eq` in
`Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Basic.lean`.
To avoid pathologies in dimension 0, we also require that `x` belongs to the closure of `s` (which
is automatic when `E` is not `0`-dimensional). -/
