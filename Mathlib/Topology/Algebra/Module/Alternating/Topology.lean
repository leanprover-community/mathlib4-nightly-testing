# Topology on continuous alternating maps

In this file we define `UniformSpace` and `TopologicalSpace` structures
on the space of continuous alternating maps between topological vector spaces.

The structures are induced by those on `ContinuousMultilinearMap`s,
and most of the lemmas follow from the corresponding lemmas about `ContinuousMultilinearMap`s.
